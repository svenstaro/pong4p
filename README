pong4p
============================

What is it?
----------------------------
A 4-player multiplayer pong clone written in Python.
I apologize for the code and the performance as it was mostly an excercise in a
 school club.

Usage
----------------------------
First initialize a server by calling ./server.py which other players can join.
Clients can then connect using ./client.py -i SERVERIP (e.g. 127.0.0.1).
If clients can't fill up all the slots, bots will take their place.

Calling either ./client.py -h or ./server.py -h will get you a list of 
available program parameters.
